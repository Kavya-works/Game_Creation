Assignment 1: Game Concept Proposal + Simple 3D Asset


Objective: To define the core concept of your game project and begin development by creating the first 3D asset. This assignment kicks off both the technical development and business planning process for your final project.



Part 1: Game Concept Proposal (Document)
Deliver a written proposal (800–1000 words) that outlines the vision for your game and begins the Game Business Plan, which will be expanded throughout the course.



Your document must include:

Game Overview:
Working title
Game genre and platform
Brief summary of the gameplay (1 paragraph)
Story & World:
Main setting and worldbuilding elements
Narrative premise and themes
Characters:
List of main characters or roles (even if abstract or non-human)
Brief backstory or character purpose
Initial Game Mechanics:
Player actions (e.g., jump, interact, attack, solve puzzles)
Core gameplay loop (what the player does repeatedly)


This document is the foundation of your final business plan. As the course progresses, you’ll expand it with more sections like audience, marketing, costs, and ROI.



Part 2: Simple 3D Model (Technical)


Create one simple 3D asset that belongs in your proposed game environment. This could be a prop, terrain feature, or background object.



Requirements:

Modeled in Blender
Low-poly and optimized
Exported in .blend and .fbx format
In a short appendix (200–300 words), describe:
How the asset fits into your game world
Basic modeling workflow used


Evaluation Criteria:
Clarity and creativity of the game concept
Feasibility of the design
Relevance and quality of the 3D model
Document structure, spelling, and grammar
Evidence of planning for future development
