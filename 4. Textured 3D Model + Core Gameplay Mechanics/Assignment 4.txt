Assignment 4: Textured 3D Model + Core Gameplay Mechanics


Objective:To apply UV unwrapping and texture mapping techniques to a previously created 3D model, and to clearly define how your game will play — what the player does, how the systems interact, and what makes the gameplay engaging.



Part 1: Textured 3D Model (Technical)


Use either your complex or optimized 3D model from previous assignments. Perform UV unwrapping and apply textures (hand-painted or procedural) to enhance the visual appeal.



Tasks:

UV unwrap the model efficiently (minimal stretching, logical seams)
Create or apply textures using Blender or external tools (e.g., Photoshop, Substance)
Export .blend, .fbx, and associated texture files (PNG/JPG/TIFF)
Render a few preview images of the textured model (with lighting if desired)


Documentation (200–300 words):

UV layout rationale (how and why you placed seams)
Texture resolution and type (diffuse, normal, etc.)
How the texturing aligns with the visual theme of your game


Part 2: Core Mechanics & Gameplay Systems (Document)


Add a new section to your Game Business Plan (700–1000 words) covering the gameplay design, including:



Core Gameplay Loop:
Describe what the player will be doing most of the time.
Outline the rhythm or flow of gameplay (e.g., explore > collect > upgrade > repeat).
Mechanics & Systems:
Explain key mechanics (e.g., combat, puzzle-solving, dialogue, crafting).
Include diagrams or system flowcharts if applicable.
Player Progression:
How will players grow? (Levels, upgrades, story progression, etc.)
What motivates continued play?
Replayability & Depth:
Will the game include randomness, branching paths, collectibles, etc.?
How does it encourage repeat engagement?


Evaluation Criteria:
Quality of UV unwrap and texture application
Consistency of textures with game style
Clarity and depth in describing gameplay mechanics
Use of visuals to support system explanations (where applicable)
