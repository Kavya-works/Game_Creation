Assignment 3: Optimized 3D Model + Market Research & Competitive Analysis


Objective: To apply polygonal modeling optimization techniques to one of your existing assets, ensuring performance efficiency for game engines, and to conduct a basic market analysis to position your game in the current industry landscape.



Part 1: Optimized 3D Model (Technical)


Take either your Assignment 1 or Assignment 2 model and apply optimization techniques to make it game-engine ready.



Tasks:

Apply modifiers like Decimate or Retopology (manual or auto)
Reduce unnecessary edge loops/vertices
Ensure clean UV layout and naming conventions
Compare the poly count before and after optimization
Provide both the original and optimized .blend and .fbx files


Documentation (200–300 words):

Describe the optimization process
Tools and techniques used (e.g., Modifiers, Cleanup tools)
Before/after poly count comparison
How optimization affects game performance and quality


Part 2: Market Research & Competitive Analysis (Document)


Expand your Game Business Plan with a new section (700–900 words) that includes:



Industry Context:
Brief overview of the current trends in your game’s genre
Emerging technologies or indie developer trends relevant to your game
Competitive Analysis:
Identify and analyze 2–3 competing games in the same genre and/or targeting the same audience
Discuss their strengths, weaknesses, and market reception
Explain how your game is different and what unique value it offers
Positioning Strategy:
How will your game stand out?
What will attract your audience away from the competition?


Evaluation Criteria:
Effectiveness of optimization (visual quality vs. performance)
Quality and depth of competitive analysis
Clarity in explaining market fit and differentiation
Document formatting, research quality, and citations (where applicable)
