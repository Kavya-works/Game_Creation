Assignment 5: Advanced Materials + Monetization & Development Cost Plan


Objective:To develop advanced materials using BlenderKit or custom shader setups, giving your game assets polished visual depth, and to define how your game will generate revenue alongside an early-stage development cost estimate.



Part 1: Advanced Materials (Technical)


Create a new asset for your game. Using BlenderKit or manual shader node setups, apply materials to bring realism, style, or atmosphere in line with your game’s visual identity.



Tasks:

Apply PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials via BlenderKit or create custom shaders
Use shader nodes to combine normal maps, specular, roughness, etc.
Create at least two versions of the material:
One realistic or physically accurate
One stylized or customized to your game’s theme
Submit .blend file and preview renders (min. 2 angles each version)


Documentation (200–300 words):

Compare both material versions: strengths, weaknesses, and visual purpose
Describe material/shader nodes used
Justify which version fits your game better and why


Part 2: Monetization & Development Costs (Document)


Add a new section to your Game Business Plan (700–900 words) addressing the financial strategy:



Monetization Strategy:
Will your game be paid, free-to-play, freemium, ad-supported, etc.?
If relevant, describe in-game purchases, cosmetics, DLC, or subscriptions
Justify pricing model based on audience and platform
Cost Breakdown:
Estimate costs for development, including:
Tools/software licenses (Blender is free, but others?)
Team roles (art, programming, marketing, QA)
Asset store purchases or plugins
Distribution/publishing
Indicate scope: solo indie, small team, or outsourcing involved?
Funding Approach:
Will you self-fund, crowdfund, seek investors, or apply for grants?
Provide a rationale for the chosen approach


Evaluation Criteria:


Depth and quality of material/shader work
Aesthetic relevance to the game’s theme
Clarity and realism in financial planning
Critical thinking on monetization ethics and audience impact
